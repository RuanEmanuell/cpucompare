## CPUCompare

This project is a webapp that allows the user to research and compare different CPUs, checking their price, image and performance, along with their current cost-benefit.
This is achieved through WebScrapping in conjunction with NodeJS's Puppeteer library, which allows you to dynamically grab information from other websites. The name, price and images
of processors are taken from internet stores and performance scoring is done based on the processor score in CPUMark, with CxB being calculated based on price and performance.
